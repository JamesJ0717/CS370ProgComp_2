            OPC, Online Programming Competition is an online programming
            competition where users can create and participate in programming
            competitions.

          </div>
          <div></div>
          <div>
            Competition hosts will have the ability to host competitions,
            and share them with competitors. Competitors then join, and submit
            their code. Competitions hosts will have full control over the
            rules of each individual competition, and be responsible for
            providing the evaluation code to test each competitors code.

            <h4>So what does OPC really do?</h4>
          </div>
          <div></div>
          <div>
            OPC is the framework for online code evaluation and scoring.
            Instead of receiving code from numerous competitors, running each
            code for output, and then running it for an evaluation score
            manually, OPC takes care of this in one fluid motion.
